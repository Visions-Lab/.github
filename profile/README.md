# 🌍 **Visions Lab**

## 🔎 **About Us**
**Visions Lab** creates modular frameworks that simplify development and automation. Our focus is on **extensible, developer-friendly tools** that enhance productivity and streamline workflows.

At the core of our ecosystem is **VISIONS**, an **open-source modular framework** that serves as the foundation for multiple development and automation projects. Similar to the **Apache Software Foundation**, VISIONS provides a **structured, expandable environment** where different projects can grow under a common ecosystem.

### **Core Components**
- **Visions Core** → A foundational **library** that provides essential utilities, APIs, and tools for all Visions-based applications, including developer utilities, HTTP services, and automation.
- **Visions Automate** → A modular **automation system** built on Visions Core, enabling users to create and manage automation tasks efficiently.
- **Visions Docs** → A **documentation hub** offering comprehensive guides, references, and best practices for all Visions Lab projects.
